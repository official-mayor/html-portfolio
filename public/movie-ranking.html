<ul>
    <li><h3>The equalizer</h3></li>
<p>my best top movie of all time filled with intense action and motivation,my best line from the movie was "when you pray for rain you gotta deal with the mud too".The actor DENZEL WASHINGTON really played a great role in the movie,he was unstoppable,fearless and showed us how bravery play's a great role in our entire lifetime.</p>

<li><h3>Avengers(infinity warefare)</h3></li>
<p>my best sci-fi movie,This movie had all aspect of what we called super hero. It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand.

<li><h3>Kung-fu panda</h3></li>
<p>Best cartoon i have watched right since my childhood,it was about a lost panda who later grew up with a foster dad and trained by a kung-fu master(Master shiffu)</p>
</ul>
